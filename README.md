# Waitwhile - The clever and simple waitlisting app

Waitwhile is a clever and free waitlist app for restaurants and other businesses to manage queuing guests. It offers a sleek design, customizable SMS alerts, wait time estimator and useful customer insights.

It's built on AngularJS, powered by Firebase and jazzed up by Twilio and Zapier. And of course Bootstrap for the suave UX!
