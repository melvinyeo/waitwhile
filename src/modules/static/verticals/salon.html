			<p>We know how crowded it can be at your salon and customers that have to wait may not always stick around. With Waitwhile, it is easy to schedule appointments for customers in line, so they can run other errands while waiting. Customers can even add themselves to your waitlist and check online how many others are ahead of them in line.

Once their appointment is ready, you can send them an SMS alert asking them to return. This means that you don't need to shout names and your guests are free to run other errands while waiting for their turn. They'll love you for it!</p>
