			<p>We know how crowded it can be at your hairdresser and customers that have to wait may not always stick around. With Waitwhile, it is easy to schedule stylist appointments for waiting customers, so they can run other errands while waiting. Customers can even add themselves to your waitlist and check online how many others are ahead in line. 
			</p>
			<p>Once a guest is added they receive a confirmation SMS which you can tailor to your salon. Once their appointment is ready, you can send them an SMS alert with just a tap asking them to return. This means that you don't need to shout names and your guests are free to run other errands while waiting for their turn. They'll love you for it!
			<p>For additional insights, you can add custom notes and view waitlist reports to spot trends and identify returning visitors. It's about time to make your customers happier and your business run smoother with Waitwhile!
