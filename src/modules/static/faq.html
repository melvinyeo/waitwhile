			<dt>Why use a waitlist app?</dt>
			<dd>With paper waitlists, locating customers is far less efficient, and you’re not capturing valuable visit history. Pagers on the other hand are clunky and expensive. With Waitwhie, you get all the benefits of a pager system but with no fuzz.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>Is it really for free?</dt>
			<dd>Yep, it's totally free and it always will be.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>Can I make my waitlist public?</dt>
			<dd>You bet! You get both a public and private waitlist. In the public one, users can only register and see their line in the waitlist. In the private one, you can send SMS alerts and remove guests from the list.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>How do I manage multiple business locations?</dt>
			<dd>Right now we only support 1 waitlist per account. If your business has multiple locations and require multiple waitlists, you can create multiple Waitwhile accounts instead. We're working on supporting multiple locations per account!</dd>

			<dt>What types of phones work with Waitwhile?</dt>
			<dd>Waitwhile works with any cell-phone in the world. Just enter your guests phone number and it will automatically support sending them SMS alerts and confirmations.</dd>

		<dl>
			<dt>What about the customers that do not have cell phones?</dt>
			<dd>If a guest doesn’t have a phone or they don't want to share their phone number, they can still be added to the waitlist for easily managing their place in line.</dd>
		</dl>
		<dl>
			<dt>Can I customize the SMS text alerts?</dt>
			<dd>Sure thing! You can tailor both for the confirmation and alert SMS to better suit your business. It even supports personalization so you can address your customer by name.</dd>
